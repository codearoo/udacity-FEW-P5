This application hopefully is intuitive enough to not need help.

The site loads up with some hard coded locations that show up on the map.

You can click on the list of places or on the map markers to show more information about them.
Extra information loaded is the first recent article from the New York Times about that place.

You can filter the list and the map markers by just typing in the search text box at the top.
